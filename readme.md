# Work Record

## July 27th

today my work just about how to get a picture thorugh D435 and calculate the similarity of these pictures.
By the beginning, I want to use normal API, but in fact, because of the complicated calling sequence. Actually, it's unncesssary to follow this way.

And then, I will  use many classical similarity metric algorithms to test the similarity ,at first.

the **target_link_library** command in CMake, just add the name part of libname.so (linux), especially the libraries installed in /usr/local/lib (the library installed by apt)
